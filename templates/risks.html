            <h2>Major Risk Factors</h2>
            <p>Several key factors significantly increase the risk of heart disease. These include high blood pressure (hypertension) and elevated cholesterol levels, along with lifestyle factors such as smoking, tobacco use, and diabetes. Being overweight or physically inactive poses additional risks. Diet choices, family history, advancing age, excessive alcohol consumption, and chronic stress all play crucial roles in heart disease development.</p>

            <h2>Uncontrollable Risks</h2>
            <p>Some risk factors for heart disease are beyond our control. These include our age, as risk naturally increases as we get older, our family history of heart disease, and certain gender-specific risk factors that can affect heart disease development and progression.</p>
