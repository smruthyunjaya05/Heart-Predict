            <h2>Healthy Habits</h2>
            <p>A heart-healthy lifestyle involves several key habits. Focus on consuming a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while exercising regularly for at least 30 minutes most days. Weight management is crucial, as is avoiding smoking and limiting alcohol intake. Practice stress management through relaxation and mindfulness techniques. Regular monitoring of blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels, combined with consistent medical check-ups and adequate sleep (7-8 hours nightly), forms a comprehensive approach to heart health.</p>
